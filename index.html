        <h2>About J.Cole</h2>
        <p>Jermaine Lamarr Cole, also known as his stage name J.Cole, is a rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Cole was born on January 28, 1985 in Frankfurt, West Germany. He was born in West Germany because his father was  based there from the U.S Army at the time. When Cole was still young his father abandoned his family and they then moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina were he was rised intill his ealry 20s. </p>
        <p>Growing up in a small city like Fayetteille, Cole always knew he just had to get out of that city to move on to bigger things. Growing up Cole was inspired by Tupac, Nas, and Eminem. His inspiration helped him with varouis music ideas, and by the time he was 14 years old he had mutiple notebooks filled with music. Throughout the way Cole's mother supported him and even bought him a drum set.  </p>
        <p>When it came time for college appications Cole had already made it his goal to get out of his small city and he chose New York City to be his first big move. Jermaine attented St. John's University in New York City, New York. In 2007 Cole had just graduated University and at that time he realized Jay Z was going to be around the city finalizing his album. Cole then burn one of his songs to Jay Z's Vol.3 [...Life And Times of S. Carter] in hopes of playing it for Jay Z. Cole waited 3 hours in the rain just for Jay Z to arrive and diss Cole, saying that he didn't want to hear his song and to give it to someone else.</p>
        <p>Jay Z's rejetion didn't impact Cole negatively instead it gave him the motivation to move forward with his passion in music. After hard work Cole appeared on Jay Z's album <em>The Blueprint</em> in 2009. Also that year he came out wiht his second mixtape <em>The Warm Up</em>  which was a huge hit. His secound album was the biggest lanch of his carrer. Since then Cole has been amzing fans with his beats and lyrics. Now J.Cole is well known as "The Mind of Music". Every where he performance he ussally always gets Sold Out concerts. J.Cole may not always be on the radio, but that may be only because his music is too over-rated for someones understanding.  </p>
